                <li>I developed a secure and user-friendly website for an automobile client, leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging online presence. To enhance user interaction, I integrated an intelligent chatbot powered by IBM Watson Assistant. This chatbot provided real-time assistance, answering queries and guiding visitors through the client's automotive offerings, ensuring a seamless and informative browsing experience.</li>
